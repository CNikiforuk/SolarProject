Assignment: Solar System Project

How to test:

  1. Download the whole repository. It is the entire project folder that was used in htdocs of XAMPP
  2. Move the files into htdocs of an XAMPP installation
  3. Start XAMPP (./xampp start)
  4. Create a database named "project" in MYSQL, and use the commands from "system.sql" to populate the tables.
  5a. I just used "root" with no password to test my database (it was not allowing authentication for other users).
  5b. If this is undesirable, you can set your own user, and pass at the top of db.php through variables $user and $pass.
  5c. Make sure that whatever user you are using has access to the "project" database.
  6. At this point you should be able to check localhost in your browser, and the main page will load.

  ALTERNATIVELY:

  1. If there is any issue, I can host it (after upping the security) on my IP temporarily.

USEFUL INFO:
  -The stars were scaled down in size, and the planets scaled up in size. Due to the inability to view it otherwise.
  -You will need to adjust the sliders at the top to get an optimal view of other solar systems (due to the properties of them being so drastically different)
    -(It feels like a bad solution, and I would rather implement a zoom and pan if I get time.)
  -The whole canvas, tabs, and all animations are created dynamically based on data in the project database. Should be 100% scalable.

  -I will be adding to this project if I get time to work on it.

  TODO:
	-include data about planets, "color : planetName" legend in canvas
	-add more systems
	-textures?
	-use semiminor and semimajor axis to more create realistic elliptical orbits rather than circular
	-rework the canvas image view / navigation, to better show the system OR
 	-entirely rework the graphics to use transformation matrices, consider webgl
